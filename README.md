Clojure tutorial: several small clojure projects with interesting clojure things

To use these tutorials, the best thing to do is install Leiningen (http://leiningen.org/)

You can install it by doing the following:

    cd /usr/local/bin
    wget https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/preview/bin/lein
    chmod +x lein

The URL may have changed so might need to check http://leiningen.org for latest.

You need to use Leiningen 2.0 or later which this link should get you, check by

    lein --version

At the time of writing, it was in preview release.
